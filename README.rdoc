This app manages the status of various Oxygen tanks around Port-au-Prince for Tikay Haiti. It displays the location of the tanks at patients houses as well as the locations of the healthcare workers. Healthcare workers are able to update the status of tanks, as well as check them in/out of the inventory system. The google maps api was used, as well as the geocoder gem.
